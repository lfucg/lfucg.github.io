<p>The City of Lexington relies on the International Property Maintenance Code, which regulates the minimum maintenance requirements for existing buildings. The code is intended to &quot;establish minimum maintenance standards for basic equipment, light, ventilation, heating, sanitation and fire safety,&quot; with the ultimate goal of providing for the &quot;regulation and safe use of existing structures in the interest of the social and economic welfare of the community.&quot; Knowledge of areas with a high number of housing code violations can help target assistance to areas that may be unsafe or need rehabilitation, as well as indicate the quality of property maintenance in an area.</p>
